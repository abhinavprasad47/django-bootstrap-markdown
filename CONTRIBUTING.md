# Want to contribute? Submit a pull request.

### Getting Started

1. Fork the repo.

2. run `$ script/bootstrap` from within a [virtual enviromnent](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/).

3. Make changes, add a feature, or fix a bug.

4. Run the tests. I _only_ take pull requests with passing tests: `$ script/test`

5. Add a test for your change. Only refactoring and documentation changes
require no new tests. If you are adding functionality or fixing a bug, I need
a test!  Not sure? ask.

6. Make the test pass.

7. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.


At this point you're waiting on me. I like to at least comment on, if not
accept, pull requests within three business days (and, typically, one business
day). I may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives.
